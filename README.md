See [ddftool](https://github.com/getlantern/ddftool) for more details on how to generate and tests fronting domains for the supported CDNs.

[!NOTE]
Since the masquerade domains and IP addresses can change, tests might fail and they need to be updated. You can basically ping some of the masquerade domains (from `default_masquerade.go`) and update the IPs accordingly.
